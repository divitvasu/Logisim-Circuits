# Logisim-Circuits (2016)

> Tools - Logisim

## About
This repository contains a collection of Logisim circuit files that I created as part of my coursework in Computer Organization. Logisim is a digital logic simulator and circuit design tool that allows you to create, simulate, and analyze digital circuits. The circuits included in this repository demonstrate various concepts and designs in computer organization, such as combinational logic, sequential logic, memory units, and more. Do note, that some circuits require importing other components, as they build up on smaller blocks.

## Execution

Install Logisim and the required version of JRE. Open the files with logisim and run. 

## Sample Demonstration

A 4-bit synchronous up-down counter: The following simulation can be made to work by setting the 'up' switch for counting upwards and vice-versa. The design consists of a combination of J-K Flip-flops, boolean gates, a clock signal and necessary switches. Do feel free to check out similar files in this repo.
